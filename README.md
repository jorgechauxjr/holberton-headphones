# 0x09. Implement a design from scratch
In this project, you will implement from scratch, without any library, a web page. You will use all HTML/CSS/Accessibility/Responsive design knowledges that you learned previously.

You won’t have a lot of instruction, you are free to implement it the way that you want - the objective is simple: Have a fully functional web page that looks the same as the designer file.

## Requirements
- You are not allowed to import external CSS framework (like Bootstrap)
- You are not allowed to use Javascript

### Tasks
#### 0. Read and be familiar with Figma
Create an account in Figma and open this project and “Duplicate to your Drafts” to have access to all design details.

#### 1. Header
Building a web page the right way, is not easy - expect if you put in place strong foundations:

- reset CSS styling
- use variables
- simple/“as generic as you can” CSS selectors
- avoid as more as you can super specific CSS selector
- simple HTML structure - div containers are your friend!
Last advice: I always start to build a web page from outside to inside and from top to bottom.

Now, your turn!

For this first task: create the header/hero piece

Here an archive of all assets needed: images_0x09.zip

#### 2. "What we do..." section 
Copy files from the previous task.

For this second task: create the “What we do…” section

In this section, you will need custom font icons. Here the archive of it: holberton_school-icon.zip Inside you will find demo page of how to use it.

Important: try to build as generic as you can… you will probably need some components in next section.

#### 3. "Our results" section 
Copy files from the previous task.

For this third task: create the “Our results” section

Now you can reuse components form the previous task!

#### 4. Contact us 
Copy files from the previous task.

A good landing page has always a contact form.

You are free to add any animations and/or constraints on fields.

#### 5. Footer 
Copy files from the previous task.

Last piece of the page… the Footer!
